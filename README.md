# Tiny theme - Add Tinylytics

**NOTE:** This plugin is for [Tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app) users (**use code "TINYTHEMEMB" for 20% off a yearly subscription, trust me, it's worth it**). It is designed to work out-of-the-box with the [Tiny Theme for Micro.blog](https://tinyformicro.blog), but other Micro.blog theme developers can add compatibility to their theme as well.

### What it does
Adds all Tinylytics features to your site:

- Analytics
- Hit Counter with or without Public Stats Link
- Kudos Button
- Webring with or without Avatars
- Country Flag Viewer

### Installation and Setup

#### To Start Tracking Traffic & Enable Kudos
1. Install from the Micro.blog plugins page
2. Click Settings next to the newly installed plugin
3. Add your Tinlytics ID and Emoji

#### Shortcodes for Hits and Uptime
You can use shortcodes in your Micro.blog posts and pages to display styled statistics. There are 4 shortcodes available:

1. `{{< hits >}}` - Shows total hits for all pages on your site.
2. `{{< hitsx >}}` - Shows hits only for the current page.
3. `{{< public_stats >}}` - Shows total hits for all pages on your site and links to your public stats page (if it exists).
4. `{{< uptime >}}` - Shows your site's uptime %. Requires a Tinyltyics **paid** account and additional setup in Tinylytics.
5. `{{< countries >}}'` - Shows a list of countries that have visited your site in emoji form
6. `{{< webring >}}` - Shows a link to the Tinylytics webring WITHOUT avatars
7. `{{< webring_avatars >}}` - Shows a link to the Tinylytics webring WITH avatars

#### Other Options
You can also display hit counters and other elements as directed by the [official documentation](https://tinylytics.app/docs) (shortcodes not required, but plugin still is required).
